                                For everyone's safety, some rules exist while you are on the track. This is not a definitive list. If you're not certain if a particular maneuver is permitted, ask the Stunt Suprvisor on duty. The Stunt Supervisor will always have the final say for safety.
                                Any rider that does not comply with the directions of the Stunt Supervisor may be ejected.
                            </p>

                                <li>OBEY the Flags!

                                        <li>Green starts the time session.</li>
                                        <li> Yellow is typically directed at one rider as warning for risky behavior.</li>
                                        <li> Red is full stop. All riders, all bikes, stop. Listen to the Stunt Supervisor and the lot will re-open quickly!</li>
                                        <li>Checkered flag marks the end of the session. Follow the directions of the Stunt Supervisor and exit the course!</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Saw a rider go down? You went down? Activate the strobe light puck attached to your bike! Do NOT cross in front of moving vehicles to reach the down rider. Stay put.</li>
                                <li>Do NOT intimidate other riders on the track. Such behaviors could be riding too closely, swerving in front of, not yielding head on, etc.</li>
                                <li>Keep it friendly. No one is an expert. No rude commentary on failed or shaky stunts</li>
                                <li>DON'T be a space hog! No, not the band. A literal space hog. Don't be that guy. Yield some room and play nice.</li>
                                <li>Generally any stunts that involve contact between two riders (such a toe touches) need to be coordinated with the Stunt Supervisor first. Additonally, the Stunt Supervisor may veto the stunt if the lot is considered too
                                    crowded.
