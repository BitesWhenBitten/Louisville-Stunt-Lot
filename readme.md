#Welcome to my project!
### I call it Louisville Stunt Lot. It's a very real idea that I would like to one day do.
###The whole concept is offering a legal and safe space to stunt riders to play around on their bikes and do ###general hooliganery.


##I have chosen these requirements to accomplish: 

###"A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes,
###such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by
###clicking the “hamburger” icon"

###"Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.
###Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes
###does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced
###feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a
###desktop."

###"Perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review on your own site and document all the
###tools and testing you used to verify your site is accessible. This may involve a written
###write-up, screenshots, and other ways of showing that you evaluated your site for
###accessibility compliance. Include the report in your GitHub repository."

###"Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button
###or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code"

###No special tools are required. The Web Accessibility Review was completed using axeDevTools in Chrome.
###A review was ran at all three breakpoints the website has to offer. The screenshots from these tests can be ###found in the folder of the same name.

###While the github repo will do just find for testing, please feel free to review the website at:
